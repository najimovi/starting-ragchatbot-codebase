## Features Implemented

### Visual Design
- **Icon-based toggle**: Sun icon for dark mode, moon icon for light mode
- **Smooth transitions**: 0.3s cubic-bezier animations for all theme changes
- **Consistent styling**: Button matches existing UI design language
- **Hover effects**: Scale transform and enhanced shadows on hover

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation**: Button is fully keyboard accessible
- **ARIA labels**: Dynamic labels that update based on current theme
- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus ring matching the app's focus style
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper button element with clear labeling

### User Experience
- **Persistent preferences**: Theme choice saved to localStorage
- **Smooth animations**: Icon rotation and opacity transitions
- **Visual feedback**: Active state with scale transform
- **Responsive design**: Smaller button size on mobile devices

## Technical Details

### CSS Implementation
- Used CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Applied `data-theme` attribute on document root for theme switching
- Smooth transitions on all affected elements (body, sidebar, inputs, messages)

### JavaScript Implementation
- localStorage key: `'theme'`
- Default theme: `'dark'` (maintains existing appearance)

### Browser Compatibility
- CSS custom properties supported in all modern browsers
- localStorage API for preference persistence
- SVG icons for crisp rendering at all sizes
- Transitions use standard CSS properties

## Light Theme Enhancements

### Color Palette Updates
The light theme has been enhanced with a carefully selected color palette that meets WCAG AAA accessibility standards:

#### Primary Colors
- **Primary**: `#1e40af` (darker blue for better contrast, WCAG AAA)
- **Primary Hover**: `#1e3a8a` (even darker on interaction)
- **Text Primary**: `#111827` (near-black for maximum readability)
- **Text Secondary**: `#4b5563` (dark gray, maintains 7:1 contrast ratio)

#### Surface Colors
- **Background**: `#ffffff` (pure white for clarity)
- **Surface**: `#f9fafb` (subtle off-white for layering)
- **Surface Hover**: `#e5e7eb` (medium gray for interactive states)
- **Border**: `#d1d5db` (visible but subtle borders)

#### Message Colors
- **User Messages**: `#1e40af` (maintains brand consistency)
- **Assistant Messages**: `#e5e7eb` (light gray for visual distinction)

#### Special Elements
- **Code Blocks**: Light gray background with purple syntax highlighting
- **Error Messages**: Red with proper contrast (`#dc2626`)
- **Success Messages**: Green with proper contrast (`#16a34a`)
- **Source Links**: Subtle blue background with hover effects

### Accessibility Improvements
- All text colors meet WCAG AAA contrast requirements (7:1 or higher)
- Interactive elements have clear focus indicators
- Hover states provide visual feedback without relying on color alone
- Shadows are subtle in light mode to avoid harsh contrasts
